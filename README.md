# OTB-Tech-Test

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) because I fancied trying out some NextJS as it's used by OTB.

And although it's definitely overkill for something like this it made sense to add some pizzazz too!

## `Some House Keeping`

Before we get started, as this is a tech test, I want to lay out what is different between what I'd do in production and here.

### `Why Aren't You Pairing?`

Well I stopped offering to pair when I realised I spend more time thinking - "they probably think you're an idiot for not knowing this now, well done, you've blown it..." - more than actually thinking about the problem I was dealing with. When in reality I was just writing an if statement and nobody was paying attention just yet.

In reality when I am comfortable and a job isn't on the line, I like to chat with folk and enjoy the process because why not!

### `Will You Write Conventional commits?`

These would be done in the real world, but its just me here and the likely-hood of anybody needing to read those to debug or revert some critical work is minimal, so I will just use descriptive commits.

### `Well, What About Unit Testing?`

I will do some testing to demonstrate but again we aren't deploying to millions of people ~~yet~~ just now so I will keep it basic.

### `Well what about all the other automated tests you idiot?!?!...`

It's just a tech test mate chill out...

### `Yeah you're right they should understand...`

No pressure then. Here we go.
